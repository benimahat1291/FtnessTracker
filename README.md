App that lets your log your workout

## Purpose

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Challanges
Making the models wassnt too challenging but,We needed to set up our connection and seed files using mongo-seed. That took some time to figure out. Mongodb has different crud syntax so that took some time to learn. The api calls was the hardest part for me. To do the Api post route to do the update I had didn't know why my call was not working untill I did some destructuring.
